title: Scalable Heterogeneous Transfer Ranking
abstract: In this paper, we propose to study the problem of heterogeneous transfer
  ranking, a transfer learning problem with heterogeneous features in order to utilize
  the rich large-scale labeled data in popular languages to help the ranking task
  in less popular languages. We develop a large-margin algorithm, namely LM-HTR, to
  solve the problem by mapping the input features in both the source domain and target
  domain into a shared latent space and simultaneously minimizing the feature reconstruction
  loss and prediction loss. We analyze the theoretical bound of the prediction loss
  and develop fast algorithms via stochastic gradient descent so that our model can
  be scalable to large-scale applications. Experiment results on two application datasets
  demonstrate the advantages of our algorithms over other state-of-the-art methods.
