title: Ensembles of Adaptive Model Rules from High-Speed Data Streams
abstract: The volume and velocity of data is increasing at astonishing rates. In order
  to extract knowledge from this huge amount of information there is a need for efficient
  on-line learning algorithms. Rule-based algorithms produce models that are easy
  to understand and can be used almost offhand. Ensemble methods combine several predicting
  models to improve the quality of prediction. In this paper, a new on-line ensemble
  method that combines a set of rule-based models is proposed to solve regression
  problems from data streams. Experimental results using synthetic and real time-evolving
  data streams show the proposed method significantly improves the performance of
  the single rule-based learner, and outperforms two state-of-the-art regression algorithms
  for data streams.
