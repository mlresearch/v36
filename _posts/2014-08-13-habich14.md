title: Towards Optimal Execution of Density-based Clustering on Heterogeneous Hardware
abstract: Data Clustering is an important and highly utilized data mining technique
  in various application domains. With ever increasing data volumes in the era of
  big data, the efficient execution of clustering algorithms is a fundamental prerequisite
  to gain understanding and acquire novel, previously unknown knowledge from data.
  To establish an efficient execution, the clustering algorithms have to be re-engineered
  to fully exploit the provided hardware capabilities. Shared-memory multiprocessor
  systems like graphics processing units (GPUs) provide extremely high parallelism
  combined with a high bandwidth transfer at low cost. The availability of such computing
  units increases with upcoming processors, where a common CPU and various computing
  units, like GPU, are tightly coupled using a unified shared memory hierarchy. In
  this paper, we consider density-based clustering for such heterogeneous systems.
  In particular, we optimize the configuration of CUDA-DClust – a density-based clustering
  algorithm for GPUs – and show that our configuration approach enables an efficient
  and deterministic execution. Our configuration approach is based on data as well
  as hardware properties, so that we are able to adjust the algorithm execution in
  both directions. In our evaluation, we show the applicability of our approach and
  present open challenges which have to be solved next.
