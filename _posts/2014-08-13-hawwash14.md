title: 'From Tweets to Stories: Using Stream-Dashboard to weave the twitter data stream
  into dynamic cluster models'
abstract: Social media has recently emerged as an invaluable source of information
  for decision making. Social media information reflects the interests of virtual
  communities in a spontaneous and timely manner. The need to understand the massive
  streams of data generated by social media platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook,
  has motivated researchers to use machine learning techniques to try to discover
  knowledge in real time. In this paper, we adapt our recently developed stream cluster
  mining, tracking and validation framework, Stream-Dashboard, to support detecting
  and tracking evolving discussion clusters in Twitter. The effectiveness of Stream-Dashboard
  in telling stories is illustrated by analyzing a couple of stories related to the
  Louisville Cardinalsâ€™ basketball championship. We further validate the detected
  story lines, that are automatically mined from user-generated tweets using as an
  alternative source, Google Trends, which are based on search queries.
