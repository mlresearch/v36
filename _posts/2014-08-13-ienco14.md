title: High density-focused uncertainty sampling for active learning over evolving
  stream data
abstract: Data labeling is an expensive and time-consuming task, hence carefully choosing
  which labels to use for training a model is becoming increasingly important. In
  the active learning setting, a classifier is trained by querying labels from a small
  representative fraction of data. While many approaches exist for non-streaming scenarios,
  few works consider the challenges of the data stream setting. We propose a new active
  learning method for evolving data streams based on a combination of density and
  prediction uncertainty (DBALStream). Our approach decides to label an instance or
  not, considering whether it lies in an high density partition of the data space.
  This allows focusing labelling efforts in the instance space where more data is
  concentrated; hence, the benefits of learning a more accurate classifier are expected
  to be higher. Instance density is approximated in an online manner by a sliding
  window mechanism, a standard technique for data streams. We compare our method with
  state-of-the-art active learning strategies over benchmark datasets. The experimental
  analysis demonstrates good predictive performance of the new approach.
