title: Parallel Graph Mining with GPUs
abstract: Frequent graph mining is an important though computationally hard problem
  because it requires enumerating possibly an exponential number of candidate subgraph
  patterns, and checking their presence in a database of graphs. In this paper, we
  propose a novel approach for parallel graph mining on GPUs, which have emerged as
  a relatively cheap but powerful architecture for general purpose computing. However,
  the thread-model for GPUs is different from that of CPUs, which makes the parallelization
  of graph mining algorithms on GPUs a challenging task. We investigate the major
  challenges for GPU-based graph mining. We perform extensive experiments on several
  real-world and synthetic datasets, achieving speedups up to 9 over the sequential
  algorithm.
