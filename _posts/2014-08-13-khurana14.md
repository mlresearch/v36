title: 'FAQ: A Framework for Fast Approximate Query Processing on Temporal Data'
abstract: Temporal queries on time evolving data are at the heart of a broad range
  of business and network intelligence applications ranging from consumer behavior
  analysis, trend analysis, temporal pattern mining, sentiment analysis on social
  media, cyber security, and network monitoring. In this work, we present an innovative
  data structure called Fast Approximate Query-able(FAQ) which provides a unified
  framework for temporal query processing on Big Data. FAQ uses a novel composition
  of data sketching, wavelet-style differencing for temporal compression, and quantization,
  and handles diverse kinds of queries including distinct counts, set membership,
  frequency estimation, top-K, p-norms, empirical entropy, and distance queries such
  as Histogram \ell_p-norm distance (including Euclidean and Manhattan distance),
  cosine similarity, Jaccard coefficient, and rank correlation. Experiments on a real-life
  multi dimensional network monitoring data sets demonstrate speedups of 92x achieved
  by FAQ over a flat representation of data for a mixed temporal query workload.
