title: A Fast Distributed Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithm for Matrix Factorization
abstract: The accuracy and effectiveness of matrix factorization technique were well
  demonstrated in the Netflix movie recommendation contest. Among the numerous solutions
  for matrix factorization, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is one of the most widely
  used algorithms. However, as a sequential approach, SGD algorithm cannot directly
  be used in the Distributed Cluster Environment (DCE). In this paper, we propose
  a fast distributed SGD algorithm named FDSGD for matrix factorization, which can
  run efficiently in DCE. This algorithm solves data sharing problem based on independent
  storage system to avoid data synchronization which may cause a big influence to
  algorithm performance, and synchronous operation problem in DCE using a distributed
  synchronization tool so that distributed cooperation threads can perform in a harmonious
  environment.
