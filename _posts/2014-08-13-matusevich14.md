title: A Clustering Algorithm Merging MCMC and EM Methods Using SQL Queries
abstract: CClustering is an important problem in Statistics and Machine Learning that
  is usually solved using Likelihood Maximization Methods, of which the Expectation-Maximization
  Algorithm (EM) is the most common. In this work we present an SQL implementation
  of an algorithm merging Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods with the EM algorithm to
  find qualitatively better solutions for the clustering problem. Even though SQL
  is not optimized for complex calculations, as it is constrained to work on tables
  and columns, it is unparalleled in handling all aspects of storage management, security
  of the information, fault management, etc. Our algorithm makes use of these characteristics
  to produce portable solutions that are comparable to the results obtained by other
  algorithms and are more efficient since the calculations are all performed inside
  the DBMS. To simplify the calculation we use very simple scalar UDFs, of a type
  that is available in most DBMS. The solution has linear time complexity on the size
  of the data set and it has a linear speedup with the number of servers in the cluster.
  This was achieved using sufficient statistics and a simplified model that assigns
  the data-points to different clusters during the E-step in an incremental manner
  and the introduction of a Sampling step in order to explore the solution space in
  a more efficient manner. Preliminary experiments show very good agreement with standard
  solutions.
