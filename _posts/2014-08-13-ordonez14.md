title: The Gamma Operator for Big Data Summarization on an Array DBMS
abstract: SciDB is a parallel array DBMS that provides multidimensional arrays, a
  query language and basic ACID  properties. In this paper,we introduce a summarization
  matrix operator that computes sufficient statistics in one pass and in parallel
  on an array DBMS. Such sufficient statistics benefit a big family of statistical
  and machine learning models, including PCA, linear regression and variable selection.
  Experimental evaluation on a parallel cluster shows our matrix operator exhibits
  linear time complexity and linear speedup. Moreover, our operator is shown to be
  an order of magnitude faster than SciDB built-in operators, two orders of magnitude
  faster than SQL queries on a fast column DBMS and even faster than the R package
  when the data set fits in RAM. We show SciDB operators and the R package fail due
  to RAM limitations, whereas our operator does not. We also show PCA and linear regression
  computation is reduced to a few minutes for large data sets. On the other hand,
  a Gibbs sampler for variable selection can iterate much faster in the array DBMS
  than in R, exploiting the summarization matrix.
