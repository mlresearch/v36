title: 'iPARAS: Incremental Construction of Parameter Space for Online Association
  Mining'
abstract: Association rule mining is known to be computationally intensive, yet real-time
  decision-making applications are increasingly intolerant to delays. The state-of-the-art
  PARAS solution, a parameter space framework for online association mining, enables
  efficient rule mining by compactly indexing the final ruleset and providing efficient
  query-time redundancy resolution. Unfortunately, as many association mining models,
  PARAS was designed for static data. Modern transaction databases undergo regular
  data updates that quickly invalidating existing rules or introducing new rules for
  the PARAS index. While reloading the PARAS index from scratch is impractical, as
  even upon minor data changes, a complete rule inference and redundancy resolution
  steps would have to be performed. We now propose to tackle this open problem by
  designing an incremental parameter space construction approach, called iPARAS, that
  utilizes the previous mining result to minimally adjust the ruleset and associated
  redundancy relationships. iPARAS features two innovative techniques. First, iPARAS
  provides an end-to-end solution, composed of three algorithms, to efficiently update
  the final ruleset in the parameter space. Second, iPARAS designs a compact data
  structure to maintain the complex redundancy relationships. Overall, iPARAS achieves
  several times speed-up on parameter space construction for transaction databases
  comparing to the state-of-the-art online association rule mining system PARAS.
