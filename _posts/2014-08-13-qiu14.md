title: Gibbs Collapsed Sampling for Latent Dirichlet Allocation on Spark
abstract: In this paper we implement a collapsed Gibbs sampling method for the widely
  used latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model on Spark. Spark is a fast in-memory
  cluster computing framework for large-scale data processing, which has been the
  talk of the Big Data town for a while. It is suitable for iterative and interactive
  algorithm. Our approach splits the dataset into P*P partitions, shuffles and recombines
  these partitions into P sub-datasets using rules to avoid conflicts of sampling,
  where each of P sub-datasets only contains P partitions, and then parallel processes
  each sub-dataset one by one. Despite increasing the number of iterations, this method
  reduces data communication overhead, makes good use of Sparkâ€™s efficient iterative
  execution and results in significant speedup on large-scale datasets in our experiments.
