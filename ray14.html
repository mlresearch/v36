	<h2>Abstract</h2>
	<div id="abstract">
		The problem of finding frequent subgraphs in large dynamic graphs has so far only considered a dynamic graph as being represented by a series of static snapshots taken at various points in time. This representation of a dynamic graph does not lend itself well to real time processing of real world graphs like social networks or internet traffic which consist of a stream of nodes and edges. In this paper we propose an algorithm that discovers the frequent subgraphs present in a graph represented by a stream of labeled nodes and edges. Our algorithm is efficient and is easily tuned by the user to produce interesting patterns from various kinds of graph data. In our model, updates to the graph arrive in the form of batches which contain new nodes and edges. Our algorithm continuously reports the frequent subgraphs that are estimated to be found in the entire graph as each batch arrives. We evaluate our system using five large dynamic graph datasets: the Hetrec 2011 challenge data, Twitter, DBLP and two synthetic. We evaluate our approach against two popular large graph miners, i.e., SUBDUE and GERM. Our experimental results show that we can find the same frequent subgraphs as a non-incremental approach applied to snapshot graphs, and in less time.
